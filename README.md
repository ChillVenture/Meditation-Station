## Team Agreement

A site that curates visuals, music, and overall theme to meet the users needs to relax

* What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
Brannon - General understanding of all applicable languages, experience in managing groups to a higher morale while working, comfortable giving and taking task based critisms, ease of blending into new teams for effective work.
Edris - Understanding and enjoyment CSS/HTML, very comfortable with written notes and following ordered lists of steps,  
Joseph - Strong foundations in JS, organization skills with good pseudo code, CLEAN CODE, high tempo while working solo or in a group,
Jordan - enjoyment of CSS, understanding of JS (somewhat), briefing experience, enjoyment of managing day to day tasks,  ability to adjust workflow based on bandwidth of team members.

* How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
Our team has varied backgrounds in a different styles of projects, with team members like Brannon and Joseph's strength in JavaScript we have a strong footing on the functional end of an application. More visual based activities could be divided to Edris and Jordan. Additionally, each team member fills a section of the project management side of the presented problem domain.

* In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Brannon - being more forward about ideas, especially on larger projects. Time management and being more agile
Edris - Listening skills, Want to work more towards a leadership position on projects, overall networking with likeminded colleagues
Joseph Streifel - more pointed decision making, (planning) and estimating
Jordan Folk - Organizational skills, Priotization, Constant improvement

* Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
We have stand up meetings with the instructor to get on the same page and our team has established a slack group together to openly share info at any hour. Paired programming for weak areas language wise. Additionally, a mid-day check up around lunch time to adjust the group's course based on what is completed prior to the mid-day meeting.


* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
If a conflict arises we plan to use other team members to moderate the discussion and find a resolution. Futhermore, we plan to attack problems at the base of the issue as opposed to correcting the individual specifically.


* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
We plan to use a group vote with the repo holder as a tie breaker for split votes


* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Mid-day meetings will be utilized to gauge the workload each member is comfortable with and capable of completing. Futhermore, we plan to review segments of new code with team members so each of them understands the syntax and methods used to achieve said goal.

* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Instead of assuming the team member is just not producing, we intend to establish an open floor style to note how difficult tasks are and use people to their strengths/interests that contribute to the project's completion. LOTS of asking for help.

* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
If we are unable resolve the issue internal we would contact a TA or the instructor to get a professional opinion.

* What hours will you be available to communicate?
9am-7pm

* What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
slack, remo, and zoom

* How often will you take breaks?
either a 50/10 split per hour or a 90/15 split on and off to step away from the work and reset through the day

* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
if we reach a 'point of no return' on the backlog, we plan to adjust our MVP to fit what the team is capable of in the timeframe


* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack group chat What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
Each presented question is asked to each group member and we have been voting on a winning idea instead of just rolling with the first idea that is presented. 

* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Genuine feedback and discussing the suggestions with the group. We want to avoid members feeling like they are tossing ideas into the dumpster when they speak. 

* How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
Mid-day meetings for day to day activities and Trello's built in task buttonology
* What project management tool will be used?
Trello
* What components of your project will live on GitHub?
we plan to host all features of the application from github
How will you share the repository with your teammates?
via github?
* What is your Git flow?
A main branch that has a work floor type branch each team member works out of and then when the a feature is working we will add it to the main branch 
Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
and when each member has provided a thumbs up we will merge it into the next step of the gitflow. We plan to send multiple PRs of possibly finished work to the work floor branch and then intend to merge completed sections into the Main branch for display purposes. There will be no set amount of required pushes to the workflow branch. The repo owner will be in charge of merging the PRs. Lastly, we will toss the pull requests into our group slack
